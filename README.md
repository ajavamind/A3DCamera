# A3DCamera
A personal 3D Camera Android App Project

This is a personal camera project intended for 3D photography hobbyists.
The app runs on the Xreal Beam Pro device and takes 3D photos exclusively.

## Features
1. Photos only captured, no video.
2. Fixed focus at about 60 cm.
3. Auto exposure adjusts to subject lighting that may not be what the photographer would like. No photographer control.
4. Back Left Camera and Right Camera images are stored as "_l" and "_r" suffix filename jpg files.
5. Analglyph conversion stored as "_ana" suffix jpg file.
6. Side-by-side stereo images are not stored by the camera.
7. Photo capture only posible with keys: camera, volume up, or volume down after key release. No touch screen capture.
8. The app display can be used as a viewfinder using a "free-viewing" eye relaxing technique to help compose your subject in 3D.
9. Image files stored in "Pictures/A3DCamera" folder.
10. Images have some EXIF capture information: example- IMG20250904_r.jpg f2.2, 1/3 second, 2.16mm, ISO413
11. Each camera image captured is 4080 x 3072 pixels (4/3 ratio).
12. The app does not align or adjust for a stereo window.
13. As a hobbyist app the user is encouraged to use "Stereo Photo Maker" to align and set the stereo window and create side-by-side photos or other formats.
14. Images may also need more contrast, color saturation and sharpening. Use Photo editors.
15. There are no camera leveling or tilt suggestions from the app - what you see is what you get.

## Usage
1. I discovered my camera lens vertical alignment is only off by 3 pixels so that live free-viewing is possible without eye strain for me. But I cannot be too close to the subject.
2. Distance to the subject should be about 1.5 meter to match the 50mm camera lens interaxial separation distance.
3. Synchronization of the camera lens shutters is not known. However the shutter speed is automatically set by the camera so motion blur is possible.
4. I use a Bluetooth remote to take photos instead of the button keys on the camera. This requires pairing with a remote controller or keyboard.
